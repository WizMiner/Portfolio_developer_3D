# 3D Earth Model with React Three Fiber

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive 3D Earth model using [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/utsuboco/react-three-fiber) and [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/utsuboco/react-three-drei) in a React application. The model is rendered with WebGL, allowing users to interact with the Earth using mouse controls like rotation and zoom.

## Go live

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://minte-portfolio.onrender.com

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Earth Model:** View and interact with a 3D Earth model rendered using WebGL.
- **Smooth Rotation:** Earth rotates automatically, with interactive controls allowing for manual rotation.
- **Responsive Design:** The model adjusts to various screen sizes, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Loading State:** Displays a loading screen while the Earth model is loading, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Customization:** Easy to extend and modify for more complex 3D scenes or different models.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core library for building the UI components.
- **react-three/fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js to create and display 3D scenes.
- **framer-motion**: A popular library for adding animations in React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design and custom styling.
- **GLTF Models**: Used for loading 3D models in the scene.
